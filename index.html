      <p class="card-text">As possible as i remember my past I get admitted into Sachar Modern kinder gadren and pre-cadet school near in my village. I study in this school about three year. At that i want to be a pilot,but my father wanted to  make me a Doctor. But my imagination was to be a pilot although i didn't know why i want to be a pilot. But it was very interesting to mine. It was memorable-days in my life and i can't forget it ever and never.  I want to tell an interesting history. When I studies class two, One day I was lost my Tiffin money. I search that money every in my school area.  But I did not found that money in any place of my school. That time my mind was too upset. That day without took Tiffin I continue my next class. But I could not concentrate about my lesson due to hungriness. Interesting matter that, when finish the class and I return my home, that time I enter my hand in my back pocket and I got my money. That time I feel very happy After completing in this school I get admitted into Sachar Govt primary school in class four.</p>
